# ðŸš€ My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is a personal journal of my journey into the world of **Machine Learning**. I'm learning by doing â€” exploring concepts, solving exercises, and applying techniques to real-world datasets. This repo will grow over time as I continue learning and building.

## ðŸ“… Weekly Progress

### âœ… Week 1: Laying the Foundations
- Revisited **Python basics** after a short break (3â€“4 months).
- Learned essential ML libraries:
  - `NumPy`
  - `Pandas`
  - `Matplotlib`
  - `Seaborn`
- Solved data cleaning and preprocessing exercises using `pandas`.
- Created basic visualizations with `matplotlib`.
- Got an overview of different types of data visualization graphs and their use-cases.

### âœ… Week 2: Diving into Supervised Learning
- Started with **Linear Regression**:
  - Understood the core theory.
  - Applied it on simple datasets (e.g., watch price prediction).
- Completed **Logistic Regression** and basic binary classification problems.
- Learned and practiced **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm:
  - Used it for classification tasks.
  - Attempted implementing KNN and Linear Regression from scratch â€” succeeded with Linear Regression.
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **feature engineering** on the [San Francisco Crime Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohier/san-francisco-crime).
  - Gained valuable insights on cleaning messy data.
  - Learned how to extract useful features from raw or seemingly unusable columns.
